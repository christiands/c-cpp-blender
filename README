this is a small demonstration of library namespacing using the same code
it is not well optimized, but it shows how much C and C++ let you abuse them

building:

- for the C version, run:
> make cver

- for the C++ version, run:
> make cxxver

- for both versions, run:
> make all

* note: you may have to change compilers around


if you get fired for using this it's not my fault
